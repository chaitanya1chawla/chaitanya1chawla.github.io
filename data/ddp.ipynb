    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project implements Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training for the Needle framework, enabling efficient multi-GPU training through model replication and gradient synchronization. The implementation uses NCCL for high-performance GPU-to-GPU communication and achieves near-linear scaling with 2-4 GPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "DDP replicates the complete model on each GPU and processes different data batches in parallel. After each backward pass, gradients are synchronized across all GPUs using all-reduce operations, then averaged to ensure parameter consistency. This approach provides linear scaling while maintaining mathematical equivalence to single-GPU training with a larger effective batch size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Key Design Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **NCCL Backend**: Direct use of NCCL for GPU-to-GPU communication, avoiding PyTorch dependencies\n",
    "- **Zero-Copy Memory**: In-place operations on GPU memory eliminate expensive CPU-GPU transfers\n",
    "- **Process-Based Architecture**: Each GPU runs in a separate process with environment-based coordination\n"

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation uses NCCL (NVIDIA Collective Communications Library) for GPU-to-GPU communication. NCCL provides optimized collective operations that enable direct GPU communication without CPU involvement, using ring and tree topologies for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Operations Used\n",
    "\n",
    "**All-Reduce**: Used for gradient synchronization. Combines gradients from all ranks using summation, then averages by dividing by world size. This ensures all GPUs have identical averaged gradients before parameter updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Broadcast**: Used for parameter initialization. Broadcasts model parameters from rank 0 to all other ranks, ensuring consistent initial state across all processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barrier**: Implemented via all-reduce on a dummy tensor to synchronize all processes at critical points.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "NCCL communicators are initialized using a unique identifier (UID) generated by the process launcher. The UID is shared via environment variables (`NCCL_UID`), and each process creates an `NcclCommunicator` instance with the same UID, world size, and its rank. This forms a communication group that enables collective operations.\n"

    "\n",
    "The DDP implementation consists of four main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Process Launcher** (`launch_ddp.py`): Generates NCCL unique ID, spawns N processes (one per GPU), and sets environment variables (`RANK`, `WORLD_SIZE`, `LOCAL_RANK`, `NCCL_UID`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Process Group** (`python/needle/distributed/__init__.py`): Manages NCCL communication. Initializes NCCL communicator based on environment variables and provides `all_reduce()`, `broadcast()`, and `barrier()` operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **DistributedDataParallel** (`python/needle/nn/nn_ddp.py`): Wraps models for distributed training. Handles parameter synchronization at initialization and gradient synchronization after backward passes using zero-copy GPU memory operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Distributed Data Loading** (`python/needle/data/distributed.py`): Implements `DistributedSampler` for round-robin dataset splitting and `DistributedDataLoader` wrapper to ensure each process receives different data batches.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 10.1 Implementation Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What is ZeRO-3?** Zero Redundancy Optimizer Stage 3 shards model states across processes to reduce memory footprint.\n",
    "- **Current implementation (in `python/needle/nn/zero3.py`)**:\n",
    "  - Shards **gradients** and **optimizer states** (e.g., Adam moments) across ranks.\n",
    "  - Uses sharded tensors to store these states, enabling significant memory savings.\n",
    "- **Limitation (WIP)**:\n",
    "  - **Parameters (`parameter.data`) are not sharded yet.** Unlike gradients/optimizer states, parameter data are actively read/written by forward/backward passes. Sharding them requires careful partitioning and gathering to maintain correctness, so this is deferred for more design/implementation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.1.1 How Parameter Sharding Would Work (plan)\n",
    "- **All-gather before compute**: Each layer would **all_gather parameter shards** before forward/backward so every rank has a temporary full copy for computation.\n",
    "- **Reduce-scatter / re-shard after update**: After the optimizer step, the updated parameters would be **reduce_scatter**/**scatter** back into shards to keep memory low.\n",
    "- **Keep states sharded**: Gradients and optimizer states stay sharded (already implemented), avoiding redundant copies.\n",
    "- **Overlap comm/compute**: Layer-wise hooks could overlap all_gather/reduce_scatter with compute to hide latency.\n",
    "- **Why harder than grads/states**: `parameter.data` is live during forward/backward; sharding it safely requires careful gather/scatter semantics to avoid stale or partial updates.\n",
